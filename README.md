# srigi/webpack-todomvc

Minimalistic example of SPA (TodoMVC) created by using:

- EcmaScript 6 with help of [babeljs.io](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) module bundler
- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) & vanilla [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)
- [karma-webpack](https://github.com/webpack/karma-webpack) test runner
- [Jasmine 2](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) behavior-driven development framework for testing 

## Goal
